# Etch-A-Sketch

This is **Etch-A-Sketch**, a browser game where you can create pixel art. It was made by me using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, for [TOP](https://www.theodinproject.com)'s [Etch-A-Sketch](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch) project!

The app currently has allows users to
- draw anything!
- randomize colors on their brush.
- erase stuff.
- create a grid size upto 100 x 100.

A **live preview** of the project can be found [here](https://sh4dman23.github.io/etch-a-sketch).
